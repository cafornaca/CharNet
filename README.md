#### CircadianScreen
CircadianScreen fills your browser with a color that corresponds to the current light cycle of the sun. 


#### EmptyFlowers
A fun web project. Displays a background of lovely flowers paired perfectly with a nihlist quote. Send it to your friends and co-workers for a fun time for everyone! 


#### DobeGen
My first coding project. This is a generator that creates a doberman pinscher given a variety of traits the dog may have such as coat color, tail, ears, etc. This project combines my love for dobermans, drawing, and programming.
